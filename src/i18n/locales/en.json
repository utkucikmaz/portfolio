		"title": "As a Person",
		"subtitle": "A brief human configuration.",
		"unformal1": "I’m a star. Physics and astronomy nerd. Philosophy diver. In love with programming, art, music, literature and every other beauty in the world, especially the ones that don’t need to justify their existence.",
		"unformal2": "I am an artistic mind trapped inside a jar, leaking paints, quietly coding escape dreams in charming languages only machines fully understand. Escaped from Plato’s cave and still lost outside. Scared of spaghettification but wonder beyond event horizons, compiling thoughts that might never terminate. Love all colors but yellow more. The child Yuri Gagarin left behind, still curious, still orbiting wonder.",
		"unformal3": "My thoughts run in infinite loops; some of them are quite elegant. Sea lover, mountain misser, gravity compiler. Question everything until the questions start questioning me back. Almost the coziest flat in town, where art, logic, music, and syntax coexist without asking permission.",
		"formal1": "I’m Utku. Born in Istanbul, currently based in Hamburg. My path into development did not begin with code, but with curiosity about people, systems, and the quiet sense of wonder that keeps questions alive.",
		"formal2": "I studied at two universities, shaped by very different kinds of structure. One was a military academy, where I focused on sociology, discipline, and order, learning how systems guide behavior. The other was Chinese Language and Literature, where structure appeared through culture, symbols, and unfamiliar logic. Long before software, trained to observe patterns, context, and meaning.",
		"formal3": "Development became the canvas where all of this formed a coherent system. For me, code is not only technical, but living, logical, human, expressive in subtle ways. Today, I build digital experiences with clarity, calm interfaces, and systems that respect both the user and the idea behind the product."
